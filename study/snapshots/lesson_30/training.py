"""
Changes compared with the previous files:
- This module is part of the project-code snapshot used by lesson 30.
- It keeps the lesson independent from future changes in `final_project`.

File purpose:
- Provide the code needed by the matching lesson script.
- Preserve a stable reference point for the course examples.
